## Abstract:

Modern consumers need modern solutions. This project attempts to utilize the weather forecast data to recommend vehicle for travellers when inclement weather is expected, who other wise uses alternate modes of transport. The system takes into consideration the preference of a traveller to choose pre-defined fuel-efficient vehicles among the ones available. The system not only helps customers to make smart decisions, but will also have an impact on the environment as well. 

## Problem Statement:

The objective of Mobility Recommendation – Dashboard is to generate a dashboard for a traveller where he can access weekly weather information, see any notifications arising due to inclement weather, choose vehicle recommendations and pre-book a vehicle for the day, see profile information and can access a vehicle scheduler. Vehicles are recommended for days of inclement weather and based on the passenger’s fuel preference.
